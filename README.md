### Power Windows with anti-pinch and 1 touch up & down:
	
 - This feature allows the user to operate the windows using a button. 
 - This system additionally incorporates an anti-pinch function which essentially means that when the window is going up automatically and something obstructs it, the window will stop rolling up and go down automatically.
